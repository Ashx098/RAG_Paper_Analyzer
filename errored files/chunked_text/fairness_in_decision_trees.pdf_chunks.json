    "text": "FairUDT: Fairness-aware Uplift Decision Trees \u22c6 Anam Zahid1, Abdur Rehman Ali1, Shaina Raza2,\u2217, Rai Shahnawaz1, Faisal Kamiran1, Asim Karim3 Training data used for developing machine learning classifiers can exhibit biases against specific protected attributes. Such biases typically originate from historical discrimination or certain underlying patterns that disproportionately under-represent minority groups, such as those identified by their gender, religion, or race. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, FairUDT, a fairnessaware Uplift-based Decision Tree for discrimination identification. FairUDT demonstrates how the integration of uplift modeling with decision trees can be adapted to include fair splitting criteria. Additionally, we introduce a modified leaf relabeling approach for removing discrimination. We divide our dataset into favored and deprived groups based on a binary sensitive attribute, with the favored dataset serving as the treatment group and the deprived dataset as the control group. By applying FairUDT and our leaf relabeling approach and can be utilized in discrimination detection tasks. Keywords: Modeling 1. Introduction Discrimination represents the unfair treatment of individuals based on their association with specific groups, influenced by characteristics like nationality, sex, age, and race.

However, fairness in decisionmaking represents a Pareto optimization problem, requiring decisions to be both accurate and fair. In standard decision tree construction, an attribute test yielding the maximum information gain for class (IGC) is selected for the split. In the seminal work of , multiple splitting criteria were designed to minimize bias in decision-making. Alongside IGC, the information gain with respect to the sensitive attribute (IGS) is also calculated for the split tests. The intuition behind this approach was to decide splits based on the maximum difference between IGC and IGS (i.e., IGC-IGS), aiming to produce leaves that are homogeneous with respect to the class label and heterogeneous with respect to the sensitive attribute. However, this approach and the IGC/IGS ratio did not demonstrate significant improvements in reducing discrimination. Another proposed criterion, (IGC+IGS), aimed at achieving homogeneity with respect to both class and sensitive attributes, yet it often lacked variation in the sensitive attribute to effectively adjust for fairness. Nevertheless, as results for such splits, when combined with a leaf relabeling technique, were better, it was adopted. In contrast, the splitting criteria of FairUDT model the difference in class probabilities between favored and deprived groups instead of modeling the actual class probabilities, with the aim of identifying subgroups at leaves that maximize uplift, or in our case, discrimination. As a result, biased sectors are identified among the tree leaves and can be addressed for fairness later. This approach is also conventional to decision tree construction as it models the amount of information a test provides about this difference. Given the goal to optimize the probabilistic differences between favored and deprived groups, our splitting criterion is logically based on distribution divergence. Following the work of , we use two different distribution divergence measures: Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL) and squared Euclidean distance. KLdivergence is a widely recognized information-theoretic measure. Although Euclidean distance is less commonly applied for comparing probability distributions, it is referenced in the literature . Given two separate probability distributions Q = (q1, q2, . . . , qn) and P = (p1, p2, . . . , pn), the divergences are defined as follows: KL(P : Q) = n",

    "text": "subsequent tree construction for either the favored or deprived group will rely on conventional entropy gain. Hence, the suggested normalization value for the KLgain test is as follows: (Recall N = N F + N D denotes the total number of records for favored and deprived datasets.) IKL(A) = H \u0012N F N , N D N KL(P F (A) : P D(A)) +N F N H(P F (A)) + N D N H(P D(A)) The first term of the equation punishes the tests that split the favored and deprived groups into different proportions. The imbalance between proportions is calculated using the divergence between two distributions, which can be arbitrarily close to infinity. However, it makes no sense to penalize on this account when there is not sufficient data available for favored and deprived groups. Therefore, the divergence part is multiplied by the entropy function H NF N , ND N , which approaches zero for massive disproportion between the number of data records for the involved groups. The second and third terms of the equation add split information for favored and deprived groups as a fraction of their records involved, hence penalizing tests with a large number of outcomes. One more concern is that very small values of the normalizing factor can inflate the value of tests with even low KLgain. To resolve this, a test is selected only if it has a greater or equal value to the average gain of all attributes. The final splitting criterion would be the fraction of Equation (3.5) and Equation (3.6). KLgainRatio = KLgain IKL(A) 3.3.2. Squared Euclidean Distance Euclidean distance was considered because of its certain advantages over KL-divergence as a distance measure. Unlike KL, it is symmetric, which has benefits in tree learning when the favored group is missing. Moreover, it is avoid infinitely large uncertain values that may lead to the wrong selection of a test attribute.

The only exception is the use of the Gini calculation instead of entropy for all the terms involved to ensure symmetry. The first term of the equation penalizes tests that create disproportionate splits between favored and deprived groups, measured by squared euclidean divergence. However, this penalty is adjusted by the function GINI NF N , N D N which approaches zero when there is a significant disparity in data records between the groups. The second and third terms incorporate split information for both groups based on the fraction of records involved, penalizing tests with many outcomes.

Discriminatory Regions and Tree Implications Subsequent to FairUDT construction, discrimination can arise at a certain leaf l \u2208L if the probability of the positive class for the favored subgroup is higher than the probability for the deprived subgroup, i.e., P F (y+|l) > P D(y+|l) (similarly, the probability of the negative class in the deprived subgroup is greater than the probability in the favored subgroup, i.e., P D(y\u2212|l) > P F (y\u2212|l)). Since FairUDT is built using probability divergence measures, the resulting leaves can contain discrimination information for subgroups, making it readily available for mitigation. Formally, the overall discrimination at a certain leaf discl can be calculated as the sum of discrimination values for the positive and negative classes: discl = (P F (y+|l) \u2212P D(y+|l)) + (P D(y\u2212|l) \u2212P F (y\u2212|l)) Definition 1: A leaf l is said to be a discriminatory region if discl > 0. After identifying the discriminatory regions, leaf relabeling is applied either by demoting the favored individuals or by promoting the deprived individuals, and the resultant decision tree can be adapted as a data pre-processor. Furthermore, a tunable parameter \u03c3t is adjusted to select leaves for relabeling. Definition 2: A leaf l can only be relabeled if discl > \u03c3t. The selection of the tunable parameter \u03c3t depends on business needs, as there is no single standard for allowable fairness in the industry. Moreover,",

The selection of the tunable parameter \u03c3t depends on business needs, as there is no single standard for allowable fairness in the industry. Moreover, tuning \u03c3t to achieve a completely fair dataset may result in poor performance, i.e., a tradeoff between fairness and performance . Hence, a domain expert is required to determine the optimal value of \u03c3t that minimizes loss of accuracy. In our settings, the value of \u03c3t ranges from 0 to 2. A value of \u03c3t = 0 indicates that all instances in the leaf must be relabeled. 4. Leaf Relabeling Contrary to the definition in Equation (3.11), the work by defined discrimination separately for positively and negatively labeled leaves, which is simply the difference in fractions of records between favored and deprived subgroups at a certain leaf. Hence, for leaves with a positive majority class, discrimination was quantified as P F (Y |l) \u2212P D(Y |l), whereas leaves with a negative majority class had a discrimination value equal to P D(Y |l)\u2212P F (Y |l). However, this formulation of discrimination is applicable only in reference to the majority class. In general, it is terribly faulty on multiple accounts. Consider a leaf having similar proportions of favored and deprived instances, but with favored instances having positive and deprived instances having negative actual class labels. This should be considered a highly discriminatory region since, in a leaf exhibiting similar features, the class probabilities differences (i.e., both acceptance and rejection rates differences) are maximal between favored and deprived subgroups. Entirely opposed to that, the discrimination value would be zero as per their definition. Thus, the settled concept for quantifying discrimination at leaves is strictly contextual. In preference to the previous approach, our proposed leaf relabeling approach is based on demoting the unnecessarily favored individuals or promoting the unjustifiably deprived individuals. Intuitively, if the majority of a subgroup is accepted, then lower acceptance and higher rejection rates for the deprived demographic within that subgroup are unjustified. Similarly, if the majority of a subgroup is rejected, then lower rejection and higher acceptance rates for the favored group within this division also indicate disparity. Henceforth, we have devised a strategy to remove disparate impact by relabeling randomly selected individual records at a certain discriminatory leaf l such that the discrimination defined by Equation (3.11) becomes 0, i.e., the equality conditions",

This is done by promoting or demoting individual records at that leaf to the majority class. \u2013Promotions: If the dominant class at a discriminatory leaf is positive, then random deprived individuals at that leaf with a negative class are promoted in the dataset. \u2013Demotions: If the majority class at a discriminatory leaf is negative, then random favored individuals at that leaf are demoted in the dataset. For equal proportions, promotions to the positive class are preferred. The complete procedure to generate the relabeled dataset (X, S, \u02dcY ) is shown in Algorithm 1. In contrast to most previous works on pre-processing [5, 54, 55], our relabeling approach incentivizes utility preservation by promoting or demoting individuals to the majority class. The end-to-end pipeline of our proposed fairness-aware approach, FairUDT The favored and deprived groups from the raw data (X, S, Y ) are first utilized in building FairUDT. After the construction of the tree, the biased subgroups are identified among the leaves L of the tree, where the discrimination discl in each leaf l is quantified by Equation (3.11). Once a tree is built, all leaves having discrimination greater than \u03c3t are relabeled. Finally, the pre-processed data (X, S, \u02dcY ) is used to train a classification algorithm. It is important to note that the test data must also be pre-processed before making predictions with the classifier. 5. Experimental Setup 5.1. Datasets We evaluated our approach on three real-world datasets, utilizing FairUDT as the data pre-processor. The summary statistics of these datasets are given in annual income of a person is greater than 50k dollar or not. The second dataset, ProPublica COMPAS dataset evaluates whether or not an individual will be arrested again within two years of its release. The individual\u2019s race is used as the sensitive attribute and has been binarized to caucasian and non-caucasian categories. The UCI German Credit dataset predicts if an individual has good or bad credit risk. 5.2. Hyperparameters and Settings For the evaluation of the proposed uplift-based discrimination-aware decision tree FairUDT, we used all the relevant dataset attributes during the preprocessing and classification phases. Using a larger group of features with more categories per feature incentivizes the discovery of fine-grained subgroups. Furthermore, the numerical features were quantized to categorical ranges. We did not implement any early stopping methodology; thus, FairUDT was extended to its maximum depth to capture highly biased instances at the tree leaves. We conducted experiments using both the KLgain and Egain ratio splitting criteria for the construction of FairUDT.",

We conducted experiments using both the KLgain and Egain ratio splitting criteria for the construction of FairUDT. Dataset N NF ND S = [ SF , SD] Attributes Adult gender = [male, female] COMPAS race =[caucasian, non-caucasian] German Credit age =[>25, <=25] Following the pre-processing of the original dataset, we employed it to fit Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers without any hyperparameter tuning, utilizing a 75-25 train-test split. All classification experiments were performed using 10-fold cross-validation and the results are reported on both the original and relabeled test sets. Additionally, to compare our results with key related prior works, we utilized the premachine learning . We used the default hyperparameter values for the previously proposed methods to ensure an unbiased comparison of results under consistent conditions. 6. Results In this section, we first present the results of the comparative analysis of FairUDT with key related prior works on data pre-processing: optimized preprocessing , reweighing , and disparate impact remover algorithms (for details on these algorithms, see Section 2). The results, summarized Next, we evaluate the performance of FairUDT using the KLgain and Egain ratio splitting criteria. We also compare the results of FairUDT with the postprocessing technique of discrimination-aware decision tree learning (DADT) proposed by . Additionally, we present a performance comparison of various classifiers when using FairUDT on the Adult dataset. As described in Section 3.2, we consider two metrics for measuring algorithmic fairness in classification tasks: demographic parity (DP) and average odds difference (AOD). We also report balanced accuracy (BA) and accuracy (Acc) for measuring the predictive performance of the classifiers after applying FairUDT. 6.1.

Results of these metrics on the raw test sets are shown with a black dashed line on each corresponding plot. From the plots, it can be seen that the fairness metrics of DP and AOD can be successfully tuned using FairUDT. As shown, the optimal value of 0.00 discrimination for these metrics can be achieved at certain thresholds of \u03c3t. For the Adult and COMPAS datasets, these metrics change gradually when tuning \u03c3t from 2.0 to 0, while an abrupt change is seen around the values of 0.61 (Adult) and 0.1 (COMPAS). This is because optimal subgroups at leaves are formed around these discrimination values discl. In contrast, this behavior is not observed for the German Credit dataset, where gradual changes in the fairness metrics are seen with varying \u03c3t. Additionally, the German Credit dataset achieves nearly 0.00 DP and AOD around the discrimination threshold of \u03c3t = 1.64. A possible explanation for this is that the German dataset contains more features (20), each with numerous unique values, leading to the formation of more fine-grained and approximately equal-sized leaves. We conclude that our approach is most effective when the original dataset has a large number of features. As expected, balanced accuracy (BA) decreases as more leaves are relabeled by moving \u03c3t towards 0. For the Adult dataset with the raw test set, this deterioration in BA is notably more significant compared to the other datasets. In the experiments, it was observed that at lower values of the discrimination threshold \u03c3t, relabeling for the Adult dataset primarily involved leaf demotions. This resulted in a larger proportion of negative-class (\u226450k) samples in the pre-processed dataset. Consequently, the classifier (LR) trained on this dataset became biased towards the negative class, leading to reduced balanced accuracy. Therefore, we emphasize the importance of tuning \u03c3t to an appropriate value according to the characteristics of the underlying dataset, in order to find an In general, this phenomenon applies to any probabilistic classifier (LR, SVM, or DT) when using the leaf relabeling technique, as the promotion and demotion of instances at the leaves affect the redistribution of class labels.

Discussion In this section, we discuss the operational and societal implications of FairUDT. We also highlight the limitations of our proposed method and suggest possible future directions to address these challenges. 7.1. Practical Impact FairUDT has numerous practical applications across industries by ensuring subgroup-level fairness in decision-making. For example, in HR and recruitment, it can help organizations comply with anti-discrimination laws by eliminating credit scoring and loan approvals while maintaining compliance with regulations. An important feature of FairUDT is to control discrimination at subgroup level by fine tuning a hyperparameter in the pre-processing phase. This would be beneficial in order to meet different business needs and regulation constraints. The use of FairUDT will also help organizations comply with anti-discrimination laws and regulations, fostering trust from customers, employees, and the public. By promoting ethical AI practices and maintaining the interpretability of decision trees, FairUDT ensures understandable and trustworthy decisions. Adhancing the overall utility of decision-making processes. 7.2. Theoretical Impact The theoretical impact of FairUDT lies in its novel approach to fairnessaware decision tree learning. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first framework to integrate discrimination-aware strategies with uplift modeling. Additionally, the proposed leaf relabeling strategy enables finer control over subgroup-level discrimination detection, advancing fairness methodologies. By",

To the best of our knowledge, it is the first framework to integrate discrimination-aware strategies with uplift modeling. Additionally, the proposed leaf relabeling strategy enables finer control over subgroup-level discrimination detection, advancing fairness methodologies. By functioning as a generalized data pre-processing tool independent of the classifier, FairUDT opens opportunities for seamless integration with other fairness techniques, such as in-processing algorithms and post-processing adjustments, paving the way for holistic fairness solutions. FairUDT can advance current fairness research and lay a foundation for future exploration in uplift modeling for discrimination detection and fairnessaware modeling. 7.3. Societal Impact FairUDT can contribute positively to society by addressing biases in automated decision-making, promoting fairness, and fostering inclusivity in areas it can reduce systemic discrimination and build trust in AI systems. However, there are potential risks: improper tuning of the model\u2019s parameters could inadvertently amplify biases, and reliance on FairUDT without comprehensive checks may lead to overconfidence in fairness outcomes. These challenges highlight the need for careful implementation and regular audits to ensure its social benefits outweigh the risks. 7.4. Limitations FairUDT operates by generating a tree to its maximum depth to capture highly biased instances at the leaves. While this approach can be effective for smaller datasets (such as those with fewer than 100k records), it may lead to overfitting and computationally complex trees in large-scale or streaming data settings, thereby impacting FairUDT\u2019s performance. However, we emphasize two key points: 1) training classifiers for socially sensitive tasks is not time-constrained, as the main focus of such applications is on ensuring fairness , and 2) under certain sparsity constraints, decision trees can perform well on datasets with large number of samples and features . Additionally, FairUDT\u2019s current formulation requires binary class labels and binary sensitive attributes, which could pose a significant challenge in real-world scenarios where multiple classes and multiple sensitive attributes exist. Moreover, FairUDT cannot handle concept drift in online data streams. To address this, we recommend conducting frequent retrainings and comparing model performance to select the best one based on accuracy and fairness metrics. Studies on model transparency [44, 48] have suggested that more intermodels such as random forests (RF) and neural networks (NN). Therefore, in domains where achieving higher accuracy is a priority, compromising on transparency might be a necessary trade-off. 7.5.

Appendix A. Notations and Definitions We are given a dataset (X, S, Y ) consisting of N number of records. Here, X represents the elements of non-sensitive attributes. Without loss of generality, assume that S = {SF , SD} is a binary sensitive attribute such as gender or race, and the outcome Y is a binary variable. The dataset is further split into two groups; favored (X, SF , Y ) and deprived (X, SD, Y ), based on the values of S. Further, N F denotes the number of records in the favored group, and N D indicates the number of records in the deprived group respectively (i.e., N = N F + N D). The class variable Y = {Y +, Y \u2212} has y as a particular label among a finite number of possible outcomes. Hence, all involved probability distributions are discrete. The probabilities for the favored and deprived groups are represented by P F and P D, respectively, while P F (Y ) and P D(Y ) denote the probabilities of the class attribute within the favored and deprived groups. In standard decision trees, there are separate testing techniques for categorical and numerical attributes. In our context, there is a single split test A for each categorical attribute which produces a finite number of outcomes a \u2208A based on distinct values. For numerical attributes, data discretization has been performed; both favored and deprived groups are combined into a single dataset for this purpose. For a specific test A, conditional probabilities over favored and deprived groups would have the form P F (Y |A) and P D(Y |A) separately. Here, P F (Y |a) and P D(Y |a) define the estimated probability distributions for the favored and deprived groups respectively, for the specific outcome A = a. Next, we define the two fairness criteria implemented in FairUDT: demographic parity and average odds difference. Additionally, we introduce the mathematical notation for balanced accuracy, the metric used alongside accuracy to evaluate the performance of the data classifier. Demographic parity (DP): Demographic parity (DP), also known as total variation (TV), statistical parity, or risk difference, is defined as measuring the discrepancy between predicting a positive outcome \u02c6Y = Y + under S = SD and S = SF . Formally, it can be written as: P( \u02c6Y = Y +|S = SF ) = P( \u02c6Y = Y +|S = SD) In real life, achieving this equality constraint is very difficult. Hence, a more relaxed criterion known as Difference in Demographic Parity (DDP) is defined: DDP = P( \u02c6Y = Y +|S = SF ) \u2212P( \u02c6Y = Y +|S = SD) A classifier is said to be fair if the value of its DDP is 0, i.e., parity across all groups. The highest and lowest values of 1 and -1, respectively, signify complete unfairness. For clarity and consistency, we have used the term demographic parity (DP) throughout our paper to refer to DDP. Average odds difference (AOD): Before defining average odds difference (AOD), it is imperative to define equality of odds (EOD), since AOD is a relaxed version of it. EOD is satisfied when both the True Positive Rate (TPR) and",

Average odds difference (AOD): Before defining average odds difference (AOD), it is imperative to define equality of odds (EOD), since AOD is a relaxed version of it. EOD is satisfied when both the True Positive Rate (TPR) and False Positive Rate (FPR) are independent of the value of the sensitive attribute. It is defined as follows: TPR : P( \u02c6Y = Y +|S = SF , Y = Y +) \u2212P( \u02c6Y = Y +|S = SD, Y = Y +) = FPR : P( \u02c6Y = Y +|S = SF , Y = Y \u2212) \u2212P( \u02c6Y = Y +|S = SD, Y = Y \u2212) In its general form, EOD can be written as: P( \u02c6Y = Y +|S = SF , Y = y) = P( \u02c6Y = Y +|S = SD, Y = y) = P( \u02c6Y = Y +|Y = y) \u2200y \u2208{+, \u2212} Similarly, AOD returns the mean value of the difference between TPR and FPR for the favored and deprived groups. It can be specified as: [TPRS=SD \u2212TPRS=SF ] + [FPRS=SD \u2212FPRS=SF ] An AOD of 0 indicates a perfect EOD. Balanced accuracy (BA): To measure the performance of the classifier, we calculate balanced accuracy (BA) instead of measuring accuracy alone. BA measures the average accuracy across all classes. Mathematically, it is calculated as the arithmetic mean of TPR and TNR (True Negative Rate): BA = TPR + TNR Balanced accuracy provides a fairer assessment of model performance compared to traditional accuracy, particularly when classes are imbalanced, as it considers both the Y + and Y \u2212class performance. Appendix B. KL-Divergence Propositions Proposition 3.1:. KLgain will be minimum iff favored and deprived class distributions are identical for all outcomes of a test A (i.e. P F (Y |a) = P D(Y |a) ). It is driven by the fact that gain value should be maximized in proportion to the divergence achieved between favored and deprived class distributions. It is an accepted property of Kullback-leibeler divergence that it would be always greater than or equal to zero KL(P F |P D) \u22650, known as Gibbs inequality . Hence, for identical P F and P D distributions it would have zero value and consolidating it with the fact that unconditional (second) term of KLgain is independent of the test proves the claim. Proposition 3.2:. KLgain would be zero if A is statistically independent of Y for both favored and deprived distributions i.e. P F (Y |a) = P F (Y ) and P D(Y |a) = P D(Y ). It will ensure that tests with no information gain for class are not selected for the split as in standard decision trees. Using assumption from the statement",

Using assumption from the statement that A is statistically independent of Y, we can replace fy(a) with fy (class probabilities test independence for favored distribution) and dy(a) with dy (class probabilities test independence for favored distribution) in Equation (3.5), it will equalize both the terms involved in the equation eventually making KLgain(A) equals zero. However, class distributions after the split can be more similar than before which will lead to negative values for splitting criterion. It implies that there can be split tests even worse than the independent split. Proposition 3.3:. KLgain reduces to entropy gain when deprived dataset is absent. Theorem 3.1. KLgain test does satisfy the stated propositions 3.1-3.3. Proof for proposition 3.3 can be found in , and reduction of KLgain to entropy gain can be seen in . Appendix C. Squared Euclidean Distance Propositions Proposition 3.5:. Egain will be minimum iff favored and deprived class distributions are same for all outcomes of a test A. It is a well known and understandable property of Euclidean distance to be always greater than or equal to zero as it is a square of difference between probability distributions values. Further, an argument similar to the one used in proof of proposition 3.1 proves the claim. Proposition 3.6:. Egain would be zero if A is statistically independent of Y for both favored and deprived datasets. Deriving from the assumption, we can replace fy(a) with fy and dy(a) with dy in Equation (3.8), as a consequence it will balance the two terms involved, hence making Egain(A) equals zero. Proposition 3.7:. Egain reduces to GINIgain if either favored or deprived group is missing. Egain reduction to GINIgain is demonstrated in , when either of the group is absent. Theorem 3.2. Egain(A) verifies the propositions 3.5-3.7 as proved above. In this section, we elucidate our evaluation of the simulatability of FairUDT. To measure simulatability, we first identify subgroups at the leaves that exhibit high discriminatory behavior. A subgroup is defined by a specific set of attributes and their values, representing the input samples for that subgroup. This identification is accomplished by selecting a single tree leaf and tracing the path from the root node to that leaf. Several discriminatory subgroups for the Adult dataset are shown in D.8.",

    "text": "To measure simulatability, we first identify subgroups at the leaves that exhibit high discriminatory behavior. A subgroup is defined by a specific set of attributes and their values, representing the input samples for that subgroup. This identification is accomplished by selecting a single tree leaf and tracing the path from the root node to that leaf. Several discriminatory subgroups for the Adult dataset are shown in D.8. which belong to favored individuals (male) from the positive class (m+), while only one instance belongs to the deprived group (female) from the negative class (f \u2212). This subgroup exhibits the highest discrimination value (2.0) in our dataset. Similarly, the fifth subgroup shows a discrimination value of 1.1, which can be explained by looking at the gender distribution across the positive and negative classes within the subgroup. We collected 30 subgroups containing discrimination, as well as subgroups that are free from discrimination, from the Adult, COMPAS, and German Credit datasets. Subsequently, we asked four computer science graduates to assign each subgroup a discrimination value (from 0 to 2), and categorize it on a scale from \u2018High\u2019 to \u2018Low\u2019 based on their understanding of the attributes and their values the average results for each dataset. We then trained the decision tree using the default parameters from the scikit-learn library , with the exception of setting the minimum number of samples in the leaf node to 3 to avoid overfitting. As discussed above, the same procedure was repeated to determine the simulatability of the decision tree for each dataset.
